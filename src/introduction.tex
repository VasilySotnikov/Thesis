Understanding the fundamental principles of Nature has been one of the most
longstanding and remarkable adventures of the human civilization.
Our perception of Nature has undoubtedly advanced to an incredible height,
nevertheless, it still seems to be in it's infancy regarding the most
fundamental questions. And if there is ever an end to this adventure, it does
not appear to come today.
It is the foremost objective of this thesis, to
contribute a tiny speck to our cumulative knowledge,
in a hope that together these contributions add up to eventually make a bigger step forward.

In the beginning of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, our best description of all combined experimental data fits into the picture of elementary particles and their local interactions.
Elementary particles, in turn, are excitations of the underlying quantum fields, which occupy the entirety of the background four-dimensional space-time.
\emph{Quantum field theory} (QFT) is the formal framework that allows to formulate this picture quantitatively.
QFT provides solid ground to a very intuitive idea,
that, to probe the most elementary structures, one needs to observe the properties of very high-energetic interactions of particles.
The shorter the length scale of phenomena in interest, the higher the energy required.\footnote{
  It is clear that this picture must, in fact, break down at most around the energy density sufficient to produce black holes.
  This exactly corresponds to the energy scale, where the unknown effects of quantum gravity are expected to become important.
}

The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is the most successful QFT to date.
It has been scrutinized experimentally over and over again in the last decades, and the
last missing piece required for its self-consistency, the Higgs particle, has been discovered recently by the most
powerful laboratory for studying  the high-energy collisions to date, the \emph{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC) at CERN.
We therefore, for the first time in the history, have a model which can be, at least in principle, extrapolated to the energy scales many orders of magnitude higher than
any characteristic scales of the model itself.
On the other hand, it is also clear, that the SM is not a complete theory.
The SM fails to address a wide variety of both theoretical concerns and (mostly astrophysical) experimental observations, such as
\begin{itemize}[nosep,topsep=-1.6ex]
  \item an ultra-violet completion of gravity,
  \item an origin of generations and the mass hierarchy in the fermion sector,
  \item baryon asymmetry in the observable universe, 
  \item an apparent existence of dark matter,
  \item[]  $\cdot\quad\cdot\quad\cdot$ %\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$\qquad $\vdots{}$
\end{itemize}
The SM is, thus, understood to be a low-energy approximation to a more fundamental theory.
It is, therefore, of central importance to exactly determine the domain of its validity,
and establish stringent constraints on potential beyond-the-standard-model extensions.

A key ingredient in this quest is the ability to interpret the measurements extracted from the collider experiments, such as the LHC, as precisely as possible.
These have to be compared to precise predictions of the SM and possibly, new physics models.
In the absence of such theory predictions, new physics may remain undetected, or the SM backgrounds may be falsely identified as such.

The discovery potential of hadron colliders is limited by both experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
While the experimental uncertainties for a wide range of observables at the LHC are, or expected to be in the near future, of the order of few percents,
theoretical predictions are in general yet to match this unprecedented level of precision.
The theoretical description of hadron collisions requires contributions from diverse areas of research.
Broadly speaking, they can be classified into the long-distance (or low-energy) effects from 
the strong-coupling regime of the quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD), the short-distance hard scattering, and
the cross-over from one to another.
Each of them reaches into a particular corner of the vast subject of quantum filed theory and represents a variety of challenges.
In this thesis we focus on the predictions for the \emph{hard scattering} process, which is where the fundamental structure of the SM is encoded to.
We obtain these predictions from the first principles through the perturbative expansion in the coupling constants of the SM,
thus, directly linking the SM to the measurements.
Naturally, the main source of theoretical uncertainties is then the truncation
of the perturbation series at some fixed order in the coupling constants.
And the systematic way to reduce this uncertainty is to include the higher orders of the expansion.

At the characteristic energy scales $t$ of the hard scattering at the LHC, the effective strong coupling constant $\alpha_s(t)$
is in the perturbative domain, but still is relatively large, compared to the couplings of the electro-weak (EW) interactions.
Therefore, the first most important corrections are generally expected to be from including the higher orders in $\alpha_s(t)$.
For a considerable number of observables,
the leading order (LO) results provide only an order-of-magnitude estimates, and cannot be used for precise measurements.
Furthermore, the LO computations, in essence, correspond to the classical limit of QFT, and do not reach into the quantum features of the SM.

Computations beyond LO involve evaluation of loop amplitudes, and, in general, are extremely challenging.
The former is the subject investigated in this thesis.
The complexity of higher order corrections grows very rapidly with number of kinematical scales and loop integrations involved.
With the current technology, at NLO order in $\alpha_s$ the processes with at most seven particles in the final state
can be considered. One of the main results of this thesis is an example of one such computation:
the NLO QCD corrections to the production of the $W$-boson, decaying into a pair of leptons, in association with 
two bottom quarks and up to three light jets. We present this computation in \cref{chap:wbb_pheno}.

The NLO QCD corrections usually provide the first reliable theoretical predictions.
The technology for the computation of NLO QCD and EW corrections has seen an explosive development
in the recent decade, and became the standard of the field with many automated public tools available.
However, reaching the percent level accuracy of theoretical predictions requires (at least) NNLO QCD corrections.
Here, the state of the art is the processes with up to two particles in the final state.
The central result of this thesis is the first computation of all two-loop five-point amplitudes, required for the production
of three jets at the hadron colliders. We present this computation in  \cref{chap:5parton}.

These computations required development and implementation of new computational algorithms.

Other highlight is the first systematic application of novel functional reconstruction techniques to obtain analytic results from numerical evaluation
for a large number of physically significant processes.

Modern computational algorithms.

Role of understanding of structure of the theory to the computations

\cref{chap:dshel} is, perhaps, one of the most important formal developments by the author of this thesis



%I have contributed to this progress
%with the major upgrade of the \BH{} library, which is now capable of computing 
%one-loop QCD matrix elements with massive fermions for high-multiplicity processes.




%To a good approximation such scattering processes factorize into the long-distance dynamics of quarks
%and gluons within protons, short distance hard interactions between these partons and, finally, the formation
%of hadrons and observable jets from the emerging partonic states and remaining proton fragments. The hard
%scattering process is a central stage in the simulation of proton collisions. The description of the hard scattering
%process through first principle computations in QCD is the central part of the proposed research.


%To successfully uncover the full physics potential provided by the LHC data,
%systematic comparison between experimental measurements and precise theoretical predictions
%is essential.
