Scattering amplitudes in QCD provide the basic building blocks for hadron
collider phenomenology. Integrated over phase space, they yield theoretical
predictions that can be compared to experimental measurements like those
performed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These theoretical
predictions can be systematically improved through inclusion of higher-order
QCD corrections, which require higher-loop scattering amplitudes.  The analytic
computation of these multi-loop amplitudes is a non-trivial task.
