The aim of this chapter is brief overview of standard computational techniques and
establishing the notation at the same time.

\section{Dimensional Regularization}
Introduction

$D_s$ and $D$

review of types: CDR, FDH and HV


\section{Loop Integrals}

Here discuss and set notation for generic loop integrals.
Say that complexity is two-fold:  reduction to a minimal set and evaluation.

Very brief overview of integral evaluation methods, we do not discuss this here.


\section{Reduction to Master Integrals}
Here introduce notions of reducibility.
Classification of tensor insertions.

Families of integrals closed under IBP identities.
