In \cref{chap:stdtech,chap:numunitarity} we were operating on the objects under the assumption that they are Lorentz scalars.
However in QFT scattering amplitudes of particles with spin are not Lorentz scalars,
and the set of all Lorentz structures generated from Feynman diagrams is immensely redundant.
In this chapter we will discuss how amplitudes of any scattering process, 
polarized or not, can be decomposed into a minimal basis of Lorentz-invariant objects.

It is well known that the full physical information about any scattering process is contained in a complete set of \textit{helicity amplitudes} ---
the amplitudes with all external particles' states chosen to have a definite helicity (see the definition in \cref{chap:4dspinhel}).
Being non-redundant and complete representation of physical information, the helicity amplitudes 
enjoy a number of nice properties such as trivialization of gauge-invariance and manifestation of PoincarÃ© symmetry.
On a technical side the consequence is that the helicity amplitudes are expected to have the most compact representation.
And indeed this has been shown to be the case in numerous practical applications (see e.g.\ %
\cite{DeLaurentis:2019phz,Badger:2019djh,Badger:2011yu,Badger:2013gxa,DeFreitas:2004kmi,Gehrmann:2011aa,Gehrmann:2009vu,Glover:2004si,Glover:2003cm,Garland:2002ak,Dunbar:2016aux,Dunbar:2016gjb,Dunbar:2016cxp,Badger:2015lda,Gehrmann:2015bfy,Bern:2003ck,Bern:2002tk,Badger:2018enw,Dunbar2017,Kunszt:1994nq}).

The computation of tree-level helicity amplitudes is a very straight-forward task,
which amounts to simply inserting the corresponding states with definite helicities for each external particle.
The spinor-helicity techniques can be employed to further enhance the computations.
Moving forward to amplitudes with loops,
we are forced to make the dimensionality of space-time formally infinite \cite{Collins:1984xc} 
to regularize divergences.\footnote{other regularization methods are out of the scope of this thesis}
This fact makes both definition and evaluation of helicity amplitudes rather delicate.
It is the purpose of this chapter to present a concise and efficient method of
evaluating multi-loop helicity amplitudes in dimensional regularization,
amenable for numerical applications.

In \cref{sec:helampl_projectors} we briefly review a somewhat standard 
method of obtaining helicity amplitudes through $D$-dimensional projectors,
which can be found in the literature \cite{Garland:2002ak, Moch:2002hm, Glover:2003cm, Glover:2004si,Gehrmann:2009vu,Gehrmann:2011aa}. 
In \cref{sec:helampl_embeding}, 
taking advantage of some insights from \cref{chap:numunitarity},
we show how the tree-level approach of ``simply inserting appropriate external states'' can
be extended to loop amplitudes in the 't Hooft-Veltman (HV) flavor of dimensional regularization.
This allows to dispose of construction of complicated projectors, which
become vary hard to handle for large $(> 4)$ number of particles with spin \cite{Peraro:2019cjj}. 
Another convenient feature of our approach is that it can be applied in a numerical context, such
as evaluation of cuts through off-shell recursion as discussed in \cref{sec:evaluation_of_cuts}.
In \cref{sec:ds_reduction} we discuss how
the efficiency of extraction of the full $D_s$-dependence can be substantially improved
by dimensionally reducing kinematically-independent degrees of freedom in higher dimensions.

\todo{Important transition between schemes} 
The two schemes are consistent,
in that their contributions to NNLO computations can be related by known
transition rules~\cite{Broggio:2015dga}, but as we
shall see below the HV scheme introduces some simplification in
the calculation.


\section{Helicity Amplitudes}

Helicity amplitudes $\mathcal{A}(\{p_i,\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}\})$ 
are defined as $\mathcal{S}$-matrix elements
with external polarization states $\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}$ chosen to be
the helicity eigenstates (for the definition of helicity see \cref{chap:4dspinhel}).
Cross-sections obtained from $\Abs{\mathcal{A}(\{p_i,\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}\})}$ describe
the scattering of polarized particles.
Unpolarized cross-sections can be obtained by summing over the helicities of all external particles
with the help of the completeness relations
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \sum_{\lambda=\{+1,-1\}} \varepsilon^\mu_\lambda(\ell){\varepsilon^\nu_\lambda}^{\star{}}(\ell)  &= -g^{\mu\nu} + \frac{\ell^\mu \eta^\nu + \ell^\nu \eta^\mu}{\sp(\ell,\eta)}, \\
    \sum_{\lambda=\{+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\}} u^\alpha_\lambda(\ell){\overline{u}_\lambda^\beta}(\ell)  &= \qty(\slashed{\ell}  \pm m\,\mathbb{1})^{\alpha\beta},
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
for gauge bosons and fermions correspondingly.
The number of $N$-particle helicity amplitudes is thus $2^N$, and
it can be further reduced by taking into an account charge and parity transformations.

The transformation of helicity amplitudes under the Lorentz boosts is completely specified by their 
external states, and is given by the \emph{little group scaling},
\begin{equation}
  \ket{p_i} \to t_i \ket{p_i}, \quad  \sket{p_i} \to \frac{1}{t_i} \ket{p_i} \implies \mathcal{A}(\{p_i,\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}\}) \to  \qty(\prod_i t_i^{-2\lambda_i}) \mathcal{A}(\{p_i,\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}\}),
\end{equation}
where $t_i$ are complex phases.
As expected the squared matrix element $\Abs{\mathcal{A}(\{p_i,\varepsilon_{i,\lambda}\})}$ is Lorentz-invariant.
With the help of spinor-helicity formalism we can also make any helicity amplitude itself into a scalar
by removing it's \emph{spinor weight} --- a factor which has the same little group scaling
as the helicity amplitude.
Hence the scalar objects we were operating on in \cref{chap:stdtech,chap:dshel} can be the rescaled helicity amplitudes.

\todo{possibly mention perturbative expansion and that the definition should apply to any loop order} 


%This can be achieved for example by normalizing all amplitudes $A^{L}_N$ with $L\geq1$ by
%a corresponding tree amplitude $A^{0}_N$ 

\section{Form-Factor Decomposition and Projectors}
\label{sec:helampl_projectors}

In this section we review a way to define helicity amplitudes in dimensional regularization through $D$-dimensional projectors.
This approach has been used in a number of computations \cite{Garland:2002ak, Moch:2002hm, Glover:2003cm, Glover:2004si,Gehrmann:2009vu,Gehrmann:2011aa}.
It's relation to HV scheme and helicity amplitudes has been recently clarified in \cite{Peraro:2019cjj} (see also \cite{Chen:2019wyb}).

One starts with decomposing an amplitude with \emph{unspecified} external states into all possible $D$-dimensional tensor structures $\mathcal{T}_i$ compatible
with symmetries and gauge invariance,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{A}  = \sum_{i} \mathcal{T}_i\;A_i.
\end{equation}
For example $\mathcal{T}_i$ can contain object like $\sp(\varepsilon(p_i),p_j)$, $\bar{v}(p_i) \slashed{p}_j u(p_k) $, $\bar{u}(p_i) \slashed{\varepsilon}(p_j) u(p_k)$, etc.
Here $A_i$ are the Lorentz-invariant form-factors.
Then one finds projectors $\mathcal{P}_i$ on $A_i$ from linear combinations of $\mathcal{T}_i$ by solving the equations
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cdr_projectors}
  \mathcal{P}_i (\mathcal{A}) = \qty(\sum_j c_{i,j}(\vb*{x},D) \sum_\text{(states)} \mathcal{T}^{\dagger}_j) \sum_{k} \mathcal{T}_k A_k = A_i, 
\end{equation}
for the coefficients $c_{i,j}(\vb*{x},D)$, which are rational functions of external kinematics $\vb*{x}$ and $D$.
Here the state sums are taken to be in $D$ dimensions, which corresponds to working in the CDR scheme.

To extract the helicity amplitudes one then \textit{evaluates} the tensor structures $\mathcal{T}_i$ 
by inserting the corresponding \textit{helicity states in four dimensions} for each of the external particles. 
This is equivalent to switching to the HV scheme.
The procedure uncovers the fact that only particular linear combinations of $A_i$ are relevant,
and the number of these combinations is exactly the number of independent helicity amplitudes, which is
significantly lower than the number of initial tensor structures $\mathcal{T}_i$.

The issues of this approach are two-fold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The number of initial tensor structures grows very fast with the number of external particles with spin.
    This makes solving the equations \cref{eq:cdr_projectors} for projectors very challenging.
  \item The projectors have to be done applied to analytic expressions since the tensor structures in $D$ dimensions have to be treated formally.
\end{enumerate}

If we accept the idea that the helicity amplitudes contain the complete physical information, 
the construction of form-factors in  \cref{eq:cdr_projectors} seems unnecessary.
And indeed recently a way to avoid these steps and construct the projector onto helicity amplitudes directly was suggested \cite{Peraro:2019cjj}.
This mitigates the problem, but there's still a problem that projectors have to be applied to analytic expressions.
\todo{paragraph still rough} 

%Formally then the corresponding space is infinite-dimensional \todo{reference Collins}, and
%it can be made to ``coincide'' with the finite-dimensional one whenever $D$ takes integer values.
%All particle transform as irreducible representations of Poincare group in $D$ dimensions,
%so the number of states becomes infinite.


%Then one switches to the HV scheme by decomposing projectors in $4$ and $(D-4)$ parts,
%and chooses four-dimensional helicity states as a basis.


\section{HV Helicity Amplitudes from Embedding of States}
\label{sec:helampl_embeding}

We show how to obtain helicity amplitudes directly, without complicated projectors, for vector and spinor particles.
We achieve this by working in HV scheme from the beginning.

We 
choosing an appropriate embedding of the physical four-dimensional state in $D_s$ dimensions.


\begin{enumerate}
  \item We build up independently from the projector approach, in the context of dimensional reconstruction. 
    However the correspondence can be straightforwardly established
  \item We need to build Lorentz symmetry $\implies $ embedding of loop momenta $\implies $ embedding of $D_s$
  \item number of states and splitting polarization sums
  \item We need Lorentz scalars $\implies $ only look at tensors in $\mathsf{S}_{[D_s-4]}$,
    and divide by little group in four dimensions
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Embedding of Vector States}
\label{sec:embedding_vectors}

This is trivially achieved for gluon helicity states: these
Are vector particles and any four-dimensional polarization state
can be embedded in a generic $D$-dimensional space by filling 
the remaining components of the vector with zeros. 
For fermion states, however, the embedding is less trivial as 
the nature of the $D$-dimensional Clifford algebra means that
there is no single associated state in $D$-dimensions.  


Comparing to the form-factor decomposition no projections are required at all.

\subsection{Embedding of Spinor States}
\label{sec:Clifford}


We consider fermions in $D_s$ dimensions, as is for instance
necessary when a CDR gluon or a singular HV gluon is emitted 
from a quark line. If the fermion line closes upon itself, as in
e.g.\ the $N_f$ corrections to gluon amplitudes
(i.e.\  corrections with a closed massless-quark loop), 
we only need the defining
property of the Clifford algebra
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:defClifford}
\{ \gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu, \gamma_{[D_s]}^\nu \} = 
2 g_{[D_s]}^{\mu\nu}\mathbb{1}_{[D_s]}^{\vphantom{\mu\nu}} \,,
\end{equation}
where we explicitly write the dimension $D_s$
as a subscript of the $\gamma$-matrices and the metric, and
use a metric with mostly-minus Minkowski signature, 
$g_{[D_s]}=\mathrm{diag}\{1, -1 , ... , -1 \}$.
Here $\mathbb{1}_{[D_s]}$ is the identity operator in the representation space of 
the Clifford algebra.
In the presence of external fermions, however, 
we must also describe the corresponding states and
an explicit
representation of the $D_s$-dimensional Clifford algebra is
required. Since we are ultimately interested in specifying
four-dimensional
external states, it is furthermore convenient to construct 
the representation in a factorized way starting from four dimensions
(see e.g.\ refs.~\cite{Kreuzer:susylectures,Collins:1984xc}).
We thus consider a Clifford algebra
in $D_s$ dimensions as the tensor product of a
four-dimensional and a $(D_s-4)$-dimensional one:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cliffordrecursion}
%
(\gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu)_{a\kappa}^{\,b\lambda}  = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll} 
		\left(\gamma_{[4]}^\mu\right)_a^{\;b} \,
		\delta_\kappa^\lambda\,, &\quad  0\le\mu \le 3 \,,\\&\\
		\left(\tilde\gamma_{[4]}\right)_a^{\;b} 
		\left(\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{(\mu-4)}\right)_\kappa^{\;\lambda}\,, 
        &\quad \mu > 3 \,,
\end{array}
		\right.
%
\end{equation}
where $\tilde\gamma_{[4]}\equiv i(\gamma_{[4]}^0
\gamma_{[4]}^1 \gamma_{[4]}^2 \gamma_{[4]}^3)$, such that 
$(\tilde\gamma_{[4]})^2 =\mathbb{1}_{[4]}$ is the identity
operator
in the four-dimensional algebra.
The indices $a,b$ denote the spinor indices in the
four-dimensional algebra and $\kappa,\lambda$ the ones of the 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional one.
The $\gamma^\mu_{[D_s-4]}$ form themselves a 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional Clifford algebra with signature
$g_{[D_s-4]}=\mathrm{diag}\{ -1 , ... , -1 \}$.

The spinor states associated with the $D_s$-dimensional 
Clifford algebra live in a $D_t$-dimensional space.\footnote{We 
remind the reader that although $D_t=2^{D_s/2}$ for any 
finite-dimensional representation, $D_t$ is set to $4$ in 
dimensional regularization \cite{Collins:1984xc}.}
For four-dimensional momenta they can be constructed from a 
tensor-product representation as
%%
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:fermionicStates}
\psi_{s,a \kappa} =  (u_h)_a (\eta^i)_\kappa \,,
\quad\mbox{and}\quad
\bar \psi_s^{a \kappa} = 
(\bar u_h)^{a}  (\bar \eta_i)^\kappa\,,
\end{equation}
%
where we have introduced an index $s=\{h, i \}$ to denote the
polarization states in terms of spinors of the four- and 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional subspaces. 
Without loss of generality we can
require that $(\eta^i)_\kappa$ and $(\bar \eta_i)^\kappa$ 
be dual to each other,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:qspinors}
(\bar \eta_i)^\kappa (\eta^j)_\kappa = \delta_i^j\,,
\end{equation}
and choose a canonical basis for the 
spinors in the $(D_s-4)$-dimensional space,
i.e.\ set $(\eta^i)_\kappa=\delta^i_\kappa$.
%
In an on-shell computation in $D_s$ dimensions we use the 
spinor states defined in eq.~\eqref{eq:fermionicStates}
as external fermion wave functions.
Given the choice of a canonical basis for the 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional states, we can identify the
$(D_s-4)$ polarization label $i$ with the spinor index 
$\kappa$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:fermionicStates}.
Thus, in the following we only insert four-dimensional spinors
and keep track of the $(D_s-4)$-dimensional embedding with 
the open $(D_s-4)$ spinor index.

\todo{ 
  As opposed to the case of vector particles we see that it's not possible to embed the spinor states from $\mathsf{S}_{[4]}$
  into $\mathsf{S}_{[D_s]}$ without introducing a preferred direction in $\mathsf{S}_{[D_s-4]}$
}
So we construct the tensor decomposition.




\subsection{Tensor Decomposition in $D_s-4$}
\label{sec:HelAmplHV}

In amplitude calculations we naturally encounter products of
$\gamma$ matrices, and in this paper we will mainly focus
on chains of $\gamma_{[D_s-4]}$ matrices. 
We thus define a convenient basis for these chains, 
constructed by anti-symmetrizing over their Lorentz
indices and given by (see e.g.\ \cite{Kreuzer:susylectures})
\begin{align}\label{eq:basisGammaChainDs}
\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu_1 \ldots \mu_n} = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{ \sigma\in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu_{\sigma(1)}} \ldots \gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu_{\sigma(n)}}\,,
\end{align}
where $S_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $n$
integers and $\sgn(\sigma)$ the signature of the permutation
$\sigma\in S_n$.





The tensor product representation of the Clifford algebra is
particularly useful to separate four- and 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional spinor indices in $\gamma$-matrix chains. 
Indeed, a product of
$\gamma$ matrices where some
Lorentz indices are within four dimensions (denoted
$\mu_i$),
and some are beyond four dimensions (denoted $\hat\mu_i$) is
split into two blocks, a four-dimensional and a 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional one. For instance, we have
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \left(\gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_1}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat \mu_2}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_3}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat\mu_4}\right)_{a\kappa}^{\,b\lambda} &=
    -\left(
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_1}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_3}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat \mu_2}
    \gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat\mu_4} \right)_{a\kappa}^{\,b\lambda} \\
    &=-\left( 
    \gamma_{[4]}^{\mu_1}
    \gamma_{[4]}^{\mu_3}
    \right)_a^{\,b}   \,\left(
    \gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{(\hat \mu_2-4)}
    \gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{(\hat \mu_4-4)}
    \right)_\kappa^{\,\lambda}  \,.
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Consider now contracting the above
product of $\gamma$ matrices with a four-dimensional fermion state,
such as the $u$ and $\bar u$ spinors:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:tensorChain}
	\bar u^a
	\left(\gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_1}
	\gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat \mu_2}
	\gamma_{[D_s]}^{\mu_3}
	\gamma_{[D_s]}^{\hat\mu_4}\right)_{a\kappa}^{\,b\lambda}
	u_b=
	-\left(\bar u
	\gamma_{[4]}^{\mu_1}
	\gamma_{[4]}^{\mu_3}
	u\right)
	\left(
	\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{(\hat \mu_2-4)}
	\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{(\hat \mu_4-4)}
	\right)_\kappa^{\,\lambda}\,.
\end{equation}
The result is a tensor with open indices in the
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional space.
We recall that these are in one-to-one
correspondence with a $(D_s-4)$-dimensional state, and the above expression (\ref{eq:tensorChain}) is
thus equivalent to a contraction with on-shell helicity states in $D_s$ dimensions.
%
Our ultimate goal is the calculation of amplitudes relevant for 
cross-section computations, and we must then understand which
tensor structures beyond four dimensions are necessary. 
This will be done in the next subsections.

We finish this section with two comments. First, we note that in the
HV scheme this tensor decomposition results in simpler expressions
than in CDR. Consider for instance the tree-level $q\bar q\to Q\bar
Q$ amplitude
\begin{equation}
  \left(M^{(0)}\right)_{\kappa_1 \kappa_2}^{\lambda_1 \lambda_2}
  \;\sim\;\; 
  \bar u^{a_1}
  \left(
  \gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu
  \right)_{a_1 \kappa_1}^{b_1 \lambda_1}
  u_{b_1}
  \,\,
  \bar u^{a_2}
  \left(
  \gamma_{[D_s]\mu}
  \right)_{a_2 \kappa_2}^{b_2 \lambda_2}
  u_{b_2}
  \,.
\end{equation}
In the HV scheme, the gluon between the two quark lines is
four dimensional, i.e.\  $\mu\leq3$, while
in the CDR scheme, the gluon is $D_s$ dimensional.
From eq.~\eqref{eqn:cliffordrecursion} we thus get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:HVvsCDR}
  \left(M^{(0)}\right)_{\kappa_1,\kappa_2}^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}
  =
  \begin{cases}
    M^{(0)}_{0}\, \delta_{\kappa_1}^{\lambda_1}
    \delta_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}& \textrm{in HV,}\\
    M^{(0)}_{0}\, \delta_{\kappa_1}^{\lambda_1}
    \delta_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}+
    M^{(0)}_{1}\,\Bigl(\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu}\Bigl)_{\kappa_1}^
    {\lambda_1}
    \Bigl(\gamma_{[D_s-4]\mu}\Bigl)_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}
    &\textrm{in CDR,}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where the $M_i^{(0)}$ are coefficients that are determined from
products of four-dimensional $\gamma$-matrices contracted with
four-dimensional spinors.
In the HV scheme the amplitude is
determined by a single coefficient, 
while in CDR two are needed. In the
remainder of this paper we thus choose to work in the HV scheme.
Nevertheless, our discussion
generalizes to the CDR scheme in a straightforward way.

The second comment we wish to make is that, 
although in this section we consider $D_s=4-2\epsilon$, which
means the Clifford algebra defined in 
eq.~\eqref{eqn:cliffordrecursion} is infinite dimensional, in
numerical calculations one might need to construct an explicit
representation of the Clifford algebra and thus
take $D_s$ to be an even integer (larger than 4).
The construction 
of eq.~\eqref{eqn:cliffordrecursion} still holds and, in fact, 
it can be iterated: any even $D_s$ can be reached
by constructing a tensor product of the
$(D_s-2)$ algebra with a 2-dimensional algebra, even if the 
$(D_s-2)$ algebra 
was already constructed as a tensor product of two
algebras.

We consider a helicity amplitude $M$, expanded in 
perturbation theory, with the $k$-th order term written as
$M^{(k)}$.
We saw previously that these are tensors in the
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional spinor space, see
eq.~\eqref{eq:HVvsCDR} for an explicit example.
Here we introduce a basis for the associated tensor space in the
spinor indices beyond four dimensions, whose elements are 
denoted as $v_n$. In general,
the basis depends on the physical process described 
by $M$ and on the order $k$ in the perturbative
expansion. We will suppress this dependence for simplicity of 
the notation and write
\begin{equation}
  M^{(k)}= \sum_n  v_n M^{(k)}_n,
\label{eq:tensorDecomposition}
\end{equation}
where the $M^{(k)}_n$ are computed from
$\gamma_{[4]}^{\mu}$ matrices and external states in four dimensions, and the tensor structure
of the amplitude in the spinor indices beyond four dimensions is
fully contained in the $v_n$.
In the following, we explicitly construct the basis $\{v_n\}$
for two families of amplitudes: those with a pair $q\bar q$ of
external
quarks and any number of external gluons, and
those with two pairs $q\bar q$ and $Q\bar Q$
of external quarks (of either different or identical
flavor) and any number of external gluons.

The different tensors $v_n$ are constructed by contracting the
Lorentz indices of chains of $\gamma_{[D_s]}$ matrices with
other Lorentz vectors in the amplitude after all loop
integrations have been performed. The remaining objects that
carry Lorentz indices are four-dimensional external momenta,
four-dimensional polarization vectors and chains of $\gamma_{[D_s]}$
matrices. Any Lorentz index in a $\gamma_{[D_s]}$-matrix 
chain that is contracted with a four-dimensional object becomes
four-dimensional, contributing only a trivial tensor structure 
in the $(D_s-4)$-dimensional space. For instance, if $\varepsilon_\mu$ represents a
four-dimensional polarization vector of an external gluon,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:trivialTens1}
	\varepsilon_\mu
	\left(
	\gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu
	\right)_{a\kappa}^{b\lambda}
	=\varepsilon_\mu\left(\gamma_{[4]}^\mu
	\right)_{a}^{b}\delta_{\kappa}^{\lambda}\,.
\end{equation}
Similarly when two Lorentz indices are contracted inside the 
same chain of $\gamma_{[D_s]}$ matrices, the tensor structure
beyond four dimensions is trivial, as follows from:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:trivialTens2}
	\left(\gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu\right)_{a \kappa}^{b_1 \lambda_1}
        \left(\gamma_{[D_s]\mu}^{\phantom{\mu}}\right)_{b_1 \lambda_1}^{b \lambda}
	=D_s\delta_{a}^{b}\delta_{\kappa}^{\lambda}\,.
\end{equation}
Non-trivial tensors $v_n$ are obtained by contracting
Lorentz indices of two chains of $\gamma_{[D_s-4]}$ matrices.
The basis introduced in eq.~\eqref{eq:basisGammaChainDs} 
for these chains is particularly useful for
computing these contractions.

Let us consider an amplitude with a pair $q\bar q$ of external
quarks and any number of external gluons. There is a single
chain of $\gamma_{[D_s-4]}$ matrices and,
as there are no other objects with $(D_s-4)$ indices, it
follows from the discussion above that
for this case there is a single term in the sum of
eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decompqqbar}
	M^{(k)}
	(q,\bar q,g,\ldots,g)
	=w_0\,M^{(k)}_0\,,\qquad
	\textrm{with}\quad
	(w_0)_{\kappa}^{\lambda}=\delta_{\kappa}^{\lambda}\,.
\end{equation}
We define the dual tensor
$w^0$ such that $w_0\cdot w^0=1$, with more details given in
appendix~\ref{sec:identities}.

Let us now consider an amplitude with two quark pairs of 
different flavors, $q\bar q$ and $Q\bar Q$, and any number of
gluons. We can now contract Lorentz indices between two 
different chains of $\gamma$ matrices, and the basis 
$\{v_n\}$ is then larger in this case. Using the basis for the
$\gamma$-matrix chains introduced in 
eq.~\eqref{eq:basisGammaChainDs}, we construct the associated
basis $\{v_n\}$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split} \label{eqn:4qtensors}
    (v_0)_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}^{\lambda_1\lambda_2}   = &
    \delta_{\kappa_1}^{\lambda_1} \delta_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}\,, \\
    (v_1)_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}^{\lambda_1\lambda_2}=
    &(\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu_1} )_{\kappa_1}^{\lambda_1} 
    (\gamma_{[D_s-4]\mu_1}^{\phantom{\mu}})_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}\,, \\
    & \vdots\\
    (v_m)_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}^{\lambda_1\lambda_2}=
    &(\gamma_{[D_s-4]}^{\mu_1 \ldots  \mu_m})_{\kappa_1}^{\lambda_1}
    (\gamma_{[D_s-4]\mu_1 \ldots \mu_m}^{\phantom{\mu}})_{\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2}\,,\\
    & \vdots\,
  \end{split}
\end{align}
where we have made explicit the indices in the $
(D_s-4)$-dimensional space.
The basis $\{v_n\}$ is infinite dimensional for
$D_s=4-2\epsilon$ (because there are infinitely many independent
terms of the form of eq.~\eqref{eq:basisGammaChainDs}), but at
each order in the perturbative
expansion only a finite number of basis elements contribute, 
as follows from inspecting the corresponding Feynman diagrams.
We thus have
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:4qampltensor}
	M^{(k)} (q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q,g,\ldots,g) =\sum_{n=0}^{n_k} v_n M^{(k)}_n\,.
\end{equation}
In the HV scheme, the decomposition is independent of the number
of external gluons. In particular,
the value of $n_k$ can be determined from the amplitude with no 
external gluons, by examining the Feynman diagrams
with the most singular gluons. 
These are ladder-type four-point diagrams with the 
gluons in the rungs. We find for instance that $n_0=0$,
$n_1=3$ and $n_2=5$ for tree-level, one- and two-loop
amplitudes, respectively. Our decomposition is similar to the 
one presented in ref.~\cite{Glover:2004si}, but differs in the
choice of basis tensors in eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}.

In practical calculations, one is interested in computing
specific coefficients $M^{(k)}_n$ in the decomposition
of eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}. We construct the
basis $\{v_n\}$ such that this operation is trivial, i.e.\  it
satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:vnproducts}
	v_n^\dagger\cdot v_m=c_n\delta^n_m\,,
	\quad
    c_0(D_s) = 1\,\quad\mbox{and}\quad  c_{n>0}(D_s)={\cal O}(\epsilon)\,.
\end{equation}
The calculation of the coefficients $c_n$ requires some 
technical operations on $\gamma$ matrices that we present in
appendix~\ref{sec:identities}.
We then construct the dual basis $\{v^n\}$, with elements
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dualBasis}
	v^n=\frac{1}{c_n} (v_n)^\dagger\,.
\end{equation}
Using the dual basis, we directly get
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:helampl}
  M^{(k)}_n = v^n \cdot M^{(k)}.
\end{equation}

Finally let us consider an amplitude with two identical quark
pairs, which can be constructed by anti-symmetrizing the
distinct-flavor amplitude $M^{(k)}$ over the two
flavors~\cite{DeFreitas:2004kmi,Glover:2004si}.
It is then easy to see that the decomposition of
eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition} requires an enlarged basis
compared to the distinct-quark case of
eq.~\eqref{eqn:4qtensors}. We thus define the tensors
$\{\tilde v_n\}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:basisIdentical}
	(\tilde v_n)_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}^{\lambda_1\lambda_2}=
	(v_n)_{\kappa_1\kappa_2}^{\lambda_2\lambda_1}\,,
\end{equation}
and the decomposition of eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}
is over the sets $\{v_n\}$ and $\{\tilde v_n\}$.
The basis tensors satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dualBasisIdentical}
	v_nv^m=\delta^m_n\,,\qquad
	\tilde v_n\tilde v^m=\delta^m_n\,,\qquad
	v_n\tilde v^m=
	\delta^m_0\,\delta_{n,0}+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\,,
\end{equation}
where the set $\{\tilde v^n\}$ is constructed to be dual to
$\{\tilde v_n\}$ in the same way as in 
eq.~\eqref{eq:dualBasis}.

We finish this subsection with a comment on the case where $D_s$
is a finite integer $D_s^0$. 
All the discussion above holds, but one
must be careful with a small detail. 
The basis of the Clifford algebra in 
eq.~\eqref{eq:basisGammaChainDs} now contains only a finite 
number of terms, and the basis of tensors $\{v_n\}$ is
consequently restricted by the dimension $D^0_s$. 
If one wants to compute the coefficient of a given tensor 
$v_i$, one must thus choose $D_s^0$ large enough such
that $v_i \in \{v_n\}$. Nevertheless, one can check that a 
calculation done in $D_s^0$ dimensions agrees 
with the $D_s=D_s^0$ limit of the same calculation done in
generic $D_s$.


\subsection{Relevant Tensor Coefficients}
\label{sec:relevant_tensors}

We have established that helicity amplitudes in dimensional
regularization are tensors in the $(D_s-4)$-dimensional space and
introduced a basis of that space on which we can decompose the
amplitude.  We should in
principle compute all coefficients in the decomposition. However, it
turns out that in a given phenomenological application not all
coefficients may be relevant. We discuss below the two cases
involving external quarks pertinent to the subject of this 
paper, the amplitudes with only external gluons being trivial in
this regard.

\todo{Compared to the form-factor decomposition in \cref{sec:helampl_projectors} it is easy to see that $v_0$ is the coefficient in HV scheme} 

\subsubsection{Examples}

\paragraph{Two-loop $q\bar qg\ldots g$ amplitude:}
For the case of an amplitude with a pair $q\bar q$ of external
quarks and any number of external gluons,
there is a single coefficient to determine, 
see eq.~\eqref{eq:decompqqbar}. At order $k$ in perturbation
theory we call this object $A^{(k)}$. It is
computed using
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qqProj}
    A^{(k)}(q,\bar q,g,\ldots,g)=M^{(k)}_0(q,\bar q,g,\ldots,g) =
	w^0\cdot M^{(k)}(q,\bar q,g,\ldots,g)\,,
\end{equation}
i.e.\ by
tracing over the $(D_s-4)$-dimensional indices of the
fermion line. In this paper we are mostly interested in $k=2$.

\paragraph{Two-loop $q\bar qQ\bar Qg\ldots g$ amplitude:}
For a
two-loop amplitude with two quark pairs of 
different flavors, $q\bar q$ and $Q\bar Q$, and any number of
gluons there are in principle six coefficients to determine. 
However, in an NNLO computation (that is not loop-induced) 
the two-loop amplitude is 
interfered with the tree amplitude, which has a single tensor
structure in the HV scheme. The contribution we must compute is of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qqQQProj}
  \left(M^{(0)}\right)^\dagger M^{(2)}=
  \left(M^{(0)}_0\right)^\dagger M^{(2)}_0\,,
\end{equation}
where we have used the orthogonality of the tensors
$v_n$ and the fact that $c_0(D_s)=1$, see 
eq.~\eqref{eqn:vnproducts}. 
For NNLO corrections, it is
thus sufficient to compute the coefficients
$M^{(2)}_0$ through
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:AmplitudeDefinition}
  A^{(2)}(q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q,g,\ldots,g)=
  M^{(2)}_0 = v^0 \cdot 
  M^{(2)}(q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q,g,\ldots,g),
\end{equation}
which amounts to computing the 
$(D_s-4)$-dimensional trace of $M^{(2)}$ on
each fermion line.  
We define the amplitude
$A^{(k)}(q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q,g,\ldots,g)$ for any order $k$
in an analogous way.

This approach is similar to the one of
ref.~\cite{Glover:2004si} and is in
agreement with the prescription of ref.~\cite{Anger:2018ove}.
On a first look, it might however look inconsistent with the 
way $q\bar qQ\bar Q$ helicity amplitudes are defined in
ref.~\cite{DeFreitas:2004kmi}. Written in the formalism
we have introduced in this section, the authors compute
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:AmpDefAlt}
	\tilde v^0\cdot M^{(2)}
	(q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q)\,,
\end{equation}
and, given the relations of eq.~\eqref{eq:dualBasisIdentical}, this
would not necessarily give the same 
$A^{(2)}(q,\bar q,Q,\bar Q)$ defined in 
eq.~\eqref{eq:AmplitudeDefinition}. For
phenomenological applications, however, 
one can show that only the
so-called \emph{finite remainder} is relevant 
\cite{Weinzierl:2011uz},
and we now show that the choices of 
eqs.~\eqref{eq:AmplitudeDefinition} and \eqref{eq:AmpDefAlt}
give the same result for this quantity.\footnote{This was 
already pointed out by the authors of 
ref.~\cite{DeFreitas:2004kmi}, who discuss the agreement of 
their finite remainder results with those of ref.~\cite{Glover:2004si}.}
We first recall that the infrared poles of a renormalized QCD
amplitude $M_R$ have a universal structure, and we can
write an amplitude in terms of its universal pole structure
and a finite remainder
which we will denote $\CF$
\cite{Catani:1998bh,Sterman:2002qn,Becher:2009cu,Gardi:2009qi}.
More explicitly, 
for a two-loop amplitude we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:remainderDef}
	M^{(2)}_R=
	\mathbf{I}^{(2)}M^{(0)}_R
	+\mathbf{I}^{(1)}M^{(1)}_R
	+\CF^{(2)}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}^{(1)}$ and $\mathbf{I}^{(2)}$ are operators in color
space. We refer the reader to appendix~\ref{sec:IR} for 
explicit expressions for these operators in the leading-color
approximation of the amplitudes considered in this paper. Since
$\CF^{(2)}$ is finite, we have
\begin{equation}
	v^0\cdot \CF^{(2)}
	=\tilde v^0\cdot \CF^{(2)}+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon),
        \label{eq:RemainderEquivalence}
\end{equation}
and the remainder computed from 
eq.~\eqref{eq:AmplitudeDefinition} thus agrees with the 
one computed from eq.~\eqref{eq:AmpDefAlt}. 


\subsection{Identical Quarks}
Finally, we now show that in the case of two pairs of
identical quarks we can also use the
definition of eq.~\eqref{eq:AmplitudeDefinition} 
for NNLO phenomenology.
The relevant contribution is the interference of the 
tree-level amplitude with the remainder, i.e.\ \begin{equation}
  \left(M^{(0)} - \tilde{M}^{(0)}\right) \cdot \left( \CF^{(2)} - \tilde{\CF}^{(2)}\right)
  =
  \left(M^{(0)}_0 - \tilde{M}^{(0)}_0 \right) \left( v_0\cdot \CF^{(2)} - \tilde{v}_0\cdot \tilde{\CF}^{(2)}\right) + O(\eps),
  \label{eq:LikeInterference}
\end{equation}
where we denote with tildes the flavor exchanged objects.  Here, we
have used the orthogonality of the $v_n$ and $\tilde{v}_n$ up to
$O(\eps)$ to simplify the expression. Importantly, the right hand side
of eq.~\eqref{eq:LikeInterference} now only contains terms that can be
computed through the definition of 
eq.~\eqref{eq:AmplitudeDefinition}.


When considering amplitudes with two identical quark lines, contributions where
index contractions lead to a single trace as in figure~\ref{fig_SingleTrace} 
should also be considered. Nevertheless, at the level of the
finite remainder, amplitudes with identical quarks can be obtained by
antisymmetrizing distinct-flavor
expressions~\cite{DeFreitas:2004kmi,Abreu:2018jgq} obtained from
eq.~\eqref{eq:defAmpsTensb}. Thus, our results are sufficient for 
NNLO QCD phenomenological studies of processes involving 
identical quarks.

\subsection{Chiral couplings ($\gamma_5$)}

\todo{do I really want this to be here\ldots?}

We emphasize that we do not invent regularization scheme thus there's nothing new we say about $\gamma_5$ issue.

At least general remarks should be written 

One clearer insight is that inconsistent algebras cannot be applied here due to non-analyticity.
So the only consistent method should be when $\gamma_5$ commutes with higher dim. matrices.


\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:dshel_discussion}

The idea of embedding external states into higher-dimensional spaces to obtain
helicity amplitudes in dimensional regularization is not new. 
It has been employed in one-loop numerical generalized
unitary methods \cite{Ellis:2007br,Giele:2008ve}, as well as as 
the so-called six-dimensional helicity formalism \cite{Bern2011,Cheung:2009dc,Badger:2013gxa,Badger:2017jhb} for two loops.
However the embedding of fermionic states, in particular any number of them,
and the relation to the HV scheme were largely glossed over,
which caused some confusion in the past.

For example if one takes a ``single'' embedding of external quarks \todo{expand on this, reference an explicit state} ,
one effectively considers an amplitude polarized in $\mathsf{S}_{[D_s-4]}$ \todo{unify space names},
so the computation carried out in this way do not correspond to the HV scheme.
Strictly speaking then the arguments we used for the dimension of embedding of loop momenta are invalidated.

At the integrand level this manifests itself as appearing of explicit components of $\ell^\mu_{i[D-4]}$, not as scalar products $\mu_{ij}$ (see \cref{sec:PartialFractions}).
At one loop this was observed as ``odd $\mu$ powers'' in \cite{Fazio:2014xea,Badger:2017gta}.
It can be shown that if there are less than two \emph{massive} quark pairs, simply discarding 
the odd $\mu$ powers leads to the HV results to $\order{\eps^0}$.
However the differences will appear starting from $\order{\epsilon}$ for any amplitude
with more than two quark pairs, massive or not.
From two-loop onwards the differences will appear already in the poles in $\epsilon$. 
For example the single embedding was used in \cite{DeFreitas:2004kmi} for the computation of two-loop four-quark amplitudes,
and the result for the amplitude differs significantly from our results and the result of \cite{Glover:2004si}.
In \cref{sec:relevant_tensors} we explained why the finite remainders agree.


 

\section{$D_s$-Dependence From Dimensional Reduction}
\label{sec:ds_reduction}
Here we explain how to improve the extraction of $D_s$-dependence.
This is crucial for amplitudes with external fermions due to the exponential scaling of the representation.


The amplitudes $A$ defined in eq.~\eqref{eq:defAmpsTens} are polynomials in $D_s$,
\begin{equation}
  A(D_s) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \mathcal{K}_i~D_s^{i}\ ,
  \label{eq:ds-poly}
\end{equation}
where $N$, the maximal power of $D_s$, 
varies depending on the process, the loop order, and the choice of tensor structure 
in eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}.
For the amplitudes considered in this paper $N\leq2$.
In this section we will suppress all arguments of $A$ and only keep track of the 
dependence on~$D_s$.
%
In a numerical framework, $A(D_s)$ can only be evaluated for integer $D_s$ values for which 
the particle states are well defined.
To be able to set $D_s=4-2\epsilon$ in the HV scheme, the knowledge of the coefficients $\mathcal{K}_i$ is required.
One way to obtain them is to reconstruct the polynomial \eqref{eq:ds-poly} from
a sample of $(N+1)$ integer values of $D_s$.
This procedure is known as dimensional reconstruction \cite{Giele:2008ve} and has  previously been applied
in \cite{Ellis:2008ir,Boughezal:2011br,Abreu:2017xsl,Abreu:2017hqn}.

While being generic and straightforward to implement, this approach has drawbacks which
become particularly evident in amplitudes with fermions.
%
The dimension of the spinor representation scales exponentially (as $2^{D_s/2}$) with $D_s$,
as opposed to the linear scaling of the vector representation.
Furthermore, the external spinor states with definite helicity can be embedded consistently
only for even values of $D_s$,
which pushes the sample values higher compared to the case of vector particles in the loops.
Beyond the obvious detrimental effect on the numerical complexity, the dimensionality of the
spinor representation determines the number of terms entering the evaluation of the traces
to obtain the helicity amplitudes through  eq.~\eqref{eq:defAmpsTens}. For
the case of amplitudes with multiple external quark pairs this makes the computation
of traces unnecessarily time consuming.

These considerations motivate the search for more efficient alternatives to dimensional
reconstruction. Here we employ one such alternative, based on the idea of
dimensional reduction, which has recently been presented in ref.~\cite{Anger:2018ove} 
and already applied to the computation of one-loop amplitudes in ref.~\cite{Anger:2017glm}.
In the remainder of this section we give a brief overview of this method 
and refer the reader to ref.~\cite{Anger:2018ove} for more technical details.

We start by rearranging eq.~\eqref{eq:ds-poly} in the following way:
\begin{equation}
  A(D_s) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i~(D_s-D_0)^{i},
  \label{eq:ds-poly-alt}
\end{equation}
where $D_0$ is some \textit{base} dimension, and the coefficients $\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i$
can be obtained by a linear transformation of the coefficients $\mathcal{K}_i$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:ds-poly}.
It turns out that, given a suitable choice of $D_0$,
the dependence of $A(D_s)$ on degrees of freedom higher than $D_0$ can
be captured in a kinematic-independent way.  
This observation allows one to analytically separate this
dependence, and thus evaluate each coefficient $\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i$
directly. Furthermore, these evaluations are then performed in the base
dimension $D_0$, resulting in spinor representations of much lower dimensionality
compared to those encountered in the framework of dimensional reconstruction.

For reasons that will become clear shortly, one chooses the base
dimension $D_0$ to be the minimal dimension which allows to embed 
all loop-momentum components without introducing new relations.
For two-loop amplitudes we have $D_0=6$, and we
shall specialize to this case henceforth. We write the metric tensor as
a direct sum,
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:ds-split-metric}
    g^{\mu\nu}_{[D_s]}  = g^{\mu\nu}_{[D_s-6]} + g^{\mu\nu}_{[6]},  \qquad
    g^{\mu\nu}_{[D_s-6]}g^{\phantom{\mu\nu}}_{\mu\nu\,[6]} = 0\,,
  \end{align}
  and the gamma matrices as a direct product 
  (see e.g.\ \cite{Collins:1984xc,Kreuzer:susylectures}),
\begin{equation}
  (\gamma_{[D_s]}^\mu)_{a\kappa}^{\,b\lambda}  = \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll} 
      \left(\gamma_{[6]}^\mu\right)_a^{\;b} \,
      \delta_\kappa^\lambda\,, &\quad  0\le\mu \le 5 \,,\\&\\
      \left(\gamma^\star_{[6]}\right)_a^{\;b} 
      \left(\gamma_{[D_s-6]}^{(\mu-6)}\right)_\kappa^{\;\lambda}\,, 
      &\quad \mu \geq 6 \,,
    \end{array}
    \right.
    \label{eq:ds-gamma}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^\star_{[6]}$ is a six-dimensional analogue of $\gamma_5$ in four dimensions, i.e.\ $\{\gamma^\star_{[6]},\gamma_{[6]}^\mu\} = 0$ for all $\mu \in \{0,5\}$, and $(\gamma^\star_{[6]})^2 = 1$.
The product representation allows us to factorize any chain of gamma matrices into a product of $6$- and $D_s-6$-dimensional gamma-matrix chains.
Then, using the fact that the trace of a direct product of two matrices is the product of their traces,
we can split the traces required to obtain the coefficients of tensor structures in eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}
as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \Tr\left(\prod_{\mu_i\in \mathcal{G}}\gamma^{\mu_i}_{[D_s]}\right) =
  \Tr\left(\prod_{\mu_i\in \tilde{\mathcal{G}}}\gamma^{\mu_i}_{[D_s-6]}\right) \cdot
  \Tr\left(\prod_{\mu_i\in \mathcal{G}}\gamma^{\mathfrak{I}(\mu_i)}_{[6]}\right),
  \label{eq:ds-split-traces}
\end{equation}
where the product on the left-hand side is over a sequence $\mathcal{G}$ of $D_s$-dimensional Lorentz indices,
$\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = \{ \mu_i \in \mathcal{G} ~\vert~ \mu_i \geq 6 \}$, and the map $\mathfrak{I}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \mathfrak{I} : \mu \to
    \begin{cases}
      \mu, & 0\le\mu \le 5\,, \\
      \star, & \mu \geq 6\,.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The traces of $\prod_{\mu_i\in\tilde{\mathcal{G}}}\gamma^{\mu_i}_{[D_s-6]}$ can be 
evaluated analytically using well-known Clifford algebra identities,
which produce sums of products of $g^{\mu_i\mu_j}_{[D_s-6]}$.
%
The crucial observation is that the only object to be contracted with the indices beyond 
$(D_s-6)$ is $g^{\mu\nu}_{[D_s-6]}$.
This is ensured by our choice of the base dimension.
These indices then always contribute terms of the form $g^\mu_{[D_s-6]\mu} = (D_s-6)$, 
generating contributions to the coefficients $\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i$ with $i>0$ 
in eq.~\eqref{eq:ds-poly-alt}. At this point, all degrees of freedom beyond $(D_s-6)$
are traded for polynomials in $(D_s-6)$ with integer factors, and the coefficients
$\tilde{\mathcal{K}}_i$ are expressed in terms of six-dimensional objects only.

\FloatBarrier

From a Feynman diagrammatic perspective, the contributions to the
coefficients of the polynomial in $(D_s-6)$
can be represented by introducing a scalar particle. 
The Feynman rules associated to this particle can be readily
derived from dimensional reduction of the original Feynman rules of the
theory \cite{Bern:2002zk,Badger:2013gxa,Giele:2008ve,Anger:2018ove} by
applying the relations \eqref{eq:ds-split-metric} and \eqref{eq:ds-gamma}.
We list them in the appendix \ref{sec:DsFeynRules} for convenience.
To illustrate this procedure we now give an example. 
Consider a decomposition of a Feynman diagram with $D_s$-dimensional particles on the 
left-hand side of figure~\ref{fig:ds-example-diagram}. The four non-vanishing 
contributions after evaluating partial traces and contracting all 
$(D_s-6)$-dimensional indices are shown on the right-hand side, 
where the scalars are introduced to represent what remains of these contractions.

We would like to conclude this section with some remarks.
First, the remaining non-trivial traces of eq.~\eqref{eq:ds-split-traces},
i.e.\ those of $\prod_k\gamma^{\mu_k}_{[6]}$, cannot be simplified generically
as the indices appear contracted with the loop momenta at the integrand level.
We evaluate them by the direct summation over a specially constructed set of external states
(in an analogous way to the sums performed in~\cite{Abreu:2018jgq} 
for dimensional reconstruction).
Secondly, in the absence of fermions in the loops, this method coincides with the so called
six-dimensional formalism employed in refs.~\cite{Badger:2013gxa,Badger:2017jhb}, and can 
thus be viewed as an extension thereof to amplitudes with fermions.
Finally, we note that the method presented in this section can be straightforwardly
generalized to higher number of loops by adjusting the base dimension $D_0$,
as well as to the extraction of coefficients of different tensor structures in 
eq.~\eqref{eq:tensorDecomposition}.
