Precise theory predictions for scattering processes are an important input for the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva.
Notably the complex collider signatures of an electroweak vector boson and many jets that originate in either light partons (light jets) or
bottom quarks ($b$ jets) are relevant for both measurements of Standard Model processes as well as searches for new
physics. In this thesis, we present new next-to-leading order QCD predictions for
two related high-multiplicity processes at the LHC $\sqrt{s} =
13$ TeV. We show predictions for \Wbb~production in association with two and three light jets that
we computed for the first time. In order to obtain the required one-loop
amplitudes, we implement the numerical unitarity approach for massive
particles in a new version of the \BlackHat{} library. To this end, we devise and apply a new algorithm for the evaluation of
$D$-dimensional unitarity cuts. It builds on a consistent embedding of external fermions states in dimensional regularization and reduces the computational complexity of our calculations. Furthermore, we
present next-to-leading order QCD predictions for $V+n$-jet production in association
with up to $n=5$ light jets for $V=W^\pm$ and with up to $n=4$ light jets for
$V=Z$, which we extend to the higher
center-of-mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider Run-II. For these processes we compare results obtained with fixed-order
scales such as $\HTpartonicp/2$ with the \MINLO{} reweighting procedure.
